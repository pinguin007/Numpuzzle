Fundamental C Practice.

Created a fun command line version of the classic Number puzzle game(aka Mystic Square, 15-puzzle).

"Sliding puzzle game consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order, with one tile missing, 
The objective of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space"

This game was helpful in making me grasp the fundamentals of C and how compilers operate.

Having most of my experience in Python and Javascript, C inhanced my understanding of Compiled Languages, and the benefits of modern languages like Python.

Learned a bit of Game Logic and the creation of Cheats to allow case testing.

Upcoming features will include a level completion timer and a GUI adaptation.
