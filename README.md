First Commit (Fundamental C Practice).

Created a Fun interactive C version of the classic Number puzzle game(aka Mystic Square, 15-puzzle).

"Sliding puzzle game consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order, with one tile missing, 
The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space. 
Endless challenge mode that challenges your logical thinking and mental limits" -- Numpuz App Google Play description

This game was helpful in making me grasp the fundamentals of C and how compilers operate.

Having most of my experience in Python and Javascript, C inhanced my understanding of Compiled Languages, Assembly, binary and creating .exe files.

Learned a bit of Game Logic and the creation of Cheats to allow case testing.

Upcoming features will include a level completion timer and a GUI adaptation.
